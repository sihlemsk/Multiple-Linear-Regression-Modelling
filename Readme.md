# Final Year Project: Predicting Athlete Performance in Long-Distance Running
## Role: Team Lead & Lead Data Analyst

## Objective:
Analyse the key factors affecting performance in long-distance running and develop predictive models using advanced statistical and machine learning techniques.

## Methodology:

### Descriptive Statistics: Conducted correlation and exploratory data analysis to identify relationships between variables, such as fitness, endurance, and maximal oxygen uptake.
### Hypothesis Testing: Tested the significance of predictors using statistical tests like Shapiro-Wilk, Levene’s test, and t-tests.
### Multiple Linear Regression Modelling:
Built three regression models, progressively refining predictors to identify the most significant variables:
Model 1: Initial regression using all predictors (R² = 0.78).
Model 2: Refined model with statistically significant predictors like lactate threshold, focus, and breathing techniques (R² = 0.92).
Model 3: Final model incorporating Box-Cox transformations for variance stabilisation, achieving robust predictions (R² = 0.93).
### Performed residual diagnostics, multicollinearity checks (Variance Inflation Factor), and Cook’s Distance analysis to validate model stability and eliminate influential data points.
Key Tools & Techniques:

### Libraries: Python (Statsmodels, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
### Techniques: Box-Cox Transformation, Residual Diagnostics, Multicollinearity Testing (VIF), Chi-square Testing, Hypothesis Testing
## Results:

Identified lactate threshold, maximal oxygen uptake, and focus as the top predictors of performance.
Delivered a final regression model with a predictive accuracy closely aligned to real-world data.
Enhanced stakeholder understanding of performance metrics through visual dashboards and clear communication of insights.
Grade Achieved: 81%
